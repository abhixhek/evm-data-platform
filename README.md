# EVM DuckDB Platform

This repo implements the project described in `evm_duckdb_platform_README.md`.

Quickstart and full documentation live in that file. The code here provides a minimal, working implementation of:
- async JSON-RPC ingestion (blocks/tx/logs)
- reorg-aware canonical index
- ERC20 Transfer decoding
- dbt + DuckDB modeling scaffolding
- GitHub Pages workflow for dbt docs

Start with `evm_duckdb_platform_README.md`.
